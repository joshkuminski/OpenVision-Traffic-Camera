WORK IN PROGRESS

OpenVision Traffic Camera is an integral component within the [OpenVision](https://github.com/joshkuminski/OpenVision) Framework for traffic monitoring. Specifically designed for conducting intersection turning movement counts, this module harnesses the power of a Raspberry Pi 4 paired with an HQ camera to provide comprehensive traffic insights.
