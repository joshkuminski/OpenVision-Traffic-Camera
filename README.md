WORK IN PROGRESS

OpenVision Traffic Camera is an integral component within the [OpenVision](https://github.com/joshkuminski/OpenVision) Framework for traffic monitoring. Specifically designed for conducting intersection turning movement counts, this module harnesses the power of a Raspberry Pi 4 paired with an HQ camera to provide comprehensive traffic insights.

This is a portable, low cost (<$2000), non-intrusive, high quality camera for recording traffic data.  With the addition of second battery pack you can hot swap packs for unlimited video recording. About 7 days of continuous recording per battery pack system. 95%+ accuracy up to 150' for a single unit.
